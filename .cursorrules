# Cursor Rules for League Bets Beta

## Migration Management Rules

### CRITICAL: Database Migration Guidelines
1. **ALWAYS ask the user before pushing any migration** - Never run `supabase db push` without explicit user permission
2. **ALWAYS use `supabase migration new` command** to create new migrations - Never manually create migration files with custom dates
3. **NEVER create migration files with dates that come before existing migrations** - This breaks the migration order and can cause serious database issues
4. **Check existing migration dates** before creating new ones to ensure proper chronological order

### Example of CORRECT workflow:
```bash
# 1. Create new migration with proper date
npx supabase migration new fix_bet_id_sequence

# 2. Edit the generated migration file
# 3. Ask user for permission before pushing
# 4. Only push after user confirms
```

### Example of INCORRECT workflow:
```bash
# ❌ DON'T DO THIS - manually creating migration files
# ❌ DON'T DO THIS - using dates that come before existing migrations
# ❌ DON'T DO THIS - pushing without user permission
```

## General Development Guidelines
- Always test changes locally before suggesting deployment
- Explain technical solutions in simple terms for non-technical users
- Use semantic search to understand the codebase before making changes
- Create todo lists for complex multi-step tasks
